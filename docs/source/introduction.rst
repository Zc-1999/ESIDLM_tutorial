ESIDLM (Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Interpretable Deep Learning Model) is a Python package developed and maintained by Dr. Yan Xing's team at Beijing Normal University `(Home Page) <https://gcess.bnu.edu.cn/yjspy/dsjj/157170.html>`_. At present, we have integrated a variety of advanced deep learning models. If you have any questions, please contact yanxing@bnu.edu.cn.

EntityDenseNet
--------------

EntityDenseNet is a DNN-based deep learning model with interpretability by combining embedding and UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection) techniques.

SIDLMNet
--------

SIDLMNet is a new Spatial-Temporal Interpretable Deep Learning Model (SIDLM) which incorporates the idea of combining linear(Wide)and non-linear(Deep) models and uses a joint training approach to model the data to improve the interpretability and predictive accuracy.

SOPINet
--------

SOPINet is an improved multi-tasking model using DNN-based model and Transformer architecture, with the ability to simultaneous retrieval PM2.5 and Ozone.
